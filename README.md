This is the source code for O'Reilly's Core HTML5 2D Game Programming video by David Geary. Like the video, the code is split into three acts, and the directories in those acts correspond to the section names in the video. For example, In Act 1 of the video, there is a graphics-and-animation section that has sections on graphics, animation, scrolling the background, and parallax. You can find the source code for those sections at:

act-1/graphics-and-animation/graphics  
act-1/graphics-and-animation/animation  
act-1/graphics-and-animation/scrolling-background  
act-1/graphics-and-animation/parallax  

Inside each of those directories, you'll typically find the following files...  

snailbait.html  
snailbait.css  
snailbait.js  

...along with a js directory containg JavaScript for things such as sprites and behaviors.
